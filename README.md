# Brightness-control-with-hand-gestures
This project implements a system to control screen brightness using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It leverages computer vision techniques to identify hand movements and adjusts brightness accordingly. The project is built using Python and integrates multiple libraries to ensure efficient gesture recognition and system interaction.
