Brightness Control with Hand Gestures in Python

This project implements a system to control screen brightness using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It leverages computer vision techniques to identify hand movements and adjusts brightness accordingly. The project uses Python and integrates multiple libraries to ensure efficient gesture recognition and system interaction.

Libraries Used:
OpenCV: For capturing video feed from the webcam and processing the images.
Mediapipe: For hand gesture detection and tracking.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
PyAutoGUI: For controlling the system's brightness level.
Math: To calculate distances and angles for precise gesture interpretation.

Features:
- Real-time hand gesture recognition.
- Intuitive control of brightness with simple hand gestures.
- Customizable gesture-to-action mapping.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the main script to start controlling brightness using hand gestures!
